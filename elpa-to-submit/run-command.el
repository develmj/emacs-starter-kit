;;; Run-command is a library to facilitate running external commands,
;;; operating at a higher level than call-process, start-process, 
;;; make-comint, etc.

;;; In addition to simplicity of use, the library includes many common
;;; facilities:

;;; * Show or hide the output buffer via a variable binding
;;; * Echo the commands which are executed to a buffer
;;; * Save existing output in a command buffer
;;; * Callbacks for asynchronous commands

;;; Some example uses of run-command:

;;; ;; Run a command synchronously
(defun mount-list-mounted-filesystems ()
  "List all mounted filesystems."
  (interactive)
  (run-command "*Mount Information*" "mount"))

;; Run a command asynchronously
(defun xlock ()
  "Run the xlock program."
  (interactive)
  (run-command-asynchronously "*XLock*" "xlock"))

;; Run a command as a comint buffer
(defun fdisk  (device)
  "Run fdisk on a device"
  (interactive "sRun Fdisk on device: ")
  (run-command-as-comint
   (concat "*Fdisk [" device "]*")
   "fdisk" device))
  


(defun nmap (host)
  "Run a network map"
  (interactive "snmap on host: ")
  (run-command-as-comint
   (concat "*nmap [" host "]*")
   "sudo" "nmap" "-sS" "-A"  host))

(defun free ()
  "memory usage"
  (interactive)
  (run-command-asynchronously "*Memory Usage*" "free" "-m"))


(defun procsocklist ()
  "procsocklist"
  (interactive)
  (run-command-asynchronously "*Proc Sock List*" "perl" "/home/ike/repository/scripts/process/procsocklist-1.1.pl"))
  

(defun psmem ()
  "Memory usage"
  (interactive)
  (run-command-asynchronously "*psmem*" "sudo" "python" (concat root-path "scripts/os/ps_mem.py")))
  

(defun psmax ()
  "Memory usage"
  (interactive)
  (run-command-asynchronously "*psmax*" "perl" "/home/ike/repository/scripts/process/psmax"))


(defun sv-status ()
  "sv status"
  (interactive)
  (run-command-asynchronously "*sv status*" "sudo" "sv" "s" "/var/service/*"))

  (run-command-asynchronously "*UPS Status*" "sudo" "apcaccess"))

(defun cpan (package) 
  "Install a CPAN package"
  (interactive "sCPAN module please: ")
  (run-command-as-comint
   (concat "*CPAN package : [" package "]*")
   "sudo" "perl" "-MCPAN" "-e" "install" package))

(defun port-forward (host local-port remote-port) 
  "Forward local-port to remote-port"

If type is 'comint, the command is run as a comint process;

commands of the correct type.
